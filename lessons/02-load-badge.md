Lesson 2: Introduction to Pillow
===

Summary
---
Load the badge template into a Pillow Image object

Notes
---
A bit of Pillow's history, focusing on its fork from PIL and a warning that a
lot of Internet resources refer to PIL, and not Pillow.

Pretty easy lesson, where we load the badge PNG from src/ and write it to dist/ to
ensure that PIL is working as expected.
