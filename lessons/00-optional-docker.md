Docker Environment for reviewers
===
Students are expected to follow module in their own Python 3 environment on
their PCs.

If you would like to follow through with the lessons, this module ships with a
full Python 3 working environment, provisioned with all dependencies installed.
*This has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04.*

See the README.md at the root of this repository for more about the Docker
working environment.
