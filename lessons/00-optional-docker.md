Docker Environment for reviewers
===
Students are expected to follow module in their own Python 3 environment on
their PCs while reading the lesson content on GitHub.

If you would like to build the code with these lessons, this module ships with a
full Python 3 working environment, provisioned with all dependencies installed.
*This has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04.*

If you would like to run the code directly on your host machine, see the [Pillow docs](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) for installation on your platform. Two dependencies in Alpine Linux are zlib and jpeg development libraries.

See the README.md at the root of this repository for more about the Docker
working environment.
